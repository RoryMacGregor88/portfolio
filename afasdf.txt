Hi, sorry for the delay in replying, I took the opportunity to go up north to visit my family, as I might not get the chance again for a while when I start working again.

First of all, thanks a lot for reaching out to me, I really appreciate it.

For clarity, my principal technology is React, that's the only one that's a must-have, anything else is flexible.

My other specialist technologies are:

Typescript, Node.js, Next.js, Redux-Thunk, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Material-UI, Jest, React Testing Library, Yup, Victory (charting library), Storybook, Mock Service Worker (MSW) and Figma.

I also have many years of experience with using Git/Github, Jira, Linux and Slack.

I'd be very grateful if you'd consider me for any roles matching these technologies that should cross your desk.

Thanks again,

Rory.
